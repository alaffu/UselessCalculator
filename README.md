# Useless calculator
This was a quick project so I could practice how to use the library pyautogui,
which is [used to control the mouse and the keyboard to automate 
interactions with other applications.](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

## What it does
You need to take screenshots of each number of the calculator app and name it
nx for x number, and then open the calculator. Done that you just run the script, type
all numbers you want to type in the calculator and hopefully the magic will happen.
